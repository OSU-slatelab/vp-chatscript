# Virtual Patient ChatScript Instance

This repository contains the patient definition files for Ohio State's Virtual
Patient project. It depends on the existence of a full [ChatScript](https://github.com/ChatScript/ChatScript) instance in the `ChatScript/` folder, and is expected to
be used in server mode with the [integration server](https://github.com/OSU-slatelab/vp-integration-server), but can be run as a standalone application.
