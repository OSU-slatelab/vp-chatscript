WHAT_IS_YOUR_GOAL "I hope you can figure out what is wrong with my back and maybe give me something for the pain. It really hurts."
DOES_ANYTHING_MAKE_YOU_FEEL_BETTER "Ibuprofen helps some, but not very much. My buddy said to try to lay in bed, so I tried that when it first happened, but I really couldn't just lay around all day.  I don't think it made a difference anyway."
TELL_ME_MORE "My buddy was moving from the second floor in an apartment building.  I bent down to help lift the couch and my back has been hurting ever since."

TELL_ME_ABOUT_YOURSELF "\[ Fear2 \]Most of my friends think I am pretty tough, but these past few days I haven't been so tough.  I guess my pain tolerance is lower than I thought.  Usually I can cut myself or get knocked around ok, but this back things has really thrown me for a loop."

HOW_OFTEN_DID_YOU_TAKE_THE_MEDICINE "I just did what it said on the bottle, two every 8 hours or so.  I haven't taken it today though,  I wanted to see what you thought I should do.  It helps, but not a lot and it seems to wear off."
HOW_LONG_TAKING_MEDICINE "I have been taking the ibuprofen ever since I hurt my back.  I am worried about taking it all of the time though.  It doesn't seem too healthy to have to take so many medications."

ARE_YOU_STILL_TAKING_MEDICINE "I haven't taken anything today.  I don't really like taking a lot of pills.  I know too many people that have to take a lot of medications every day.  I don't really trust pills."
WHAT_WAS_THE_DOSE "I'm not sure, I just took what it said on the bottle.  It was a red capsule if that helps."
WHAT_PILLS_DID_YOU_TAKE "I took some ibuprofen for a few days."
WHAT_KIND_OF_MEDICINE_IS_THAT "Just a painkiller as far as I know.  My aunt told me it is the best one to use for aches and pains."

DOCTOR_PRESCRIBE_THE_MEDICINE "Yes."

CAN_YOU_CLIMB_STAIRS "\[ Pain2 \]Stairs are pretty rough though, it is hard to keep my back still while climbing them.

One of these days my neighbors are going to think I am trying to rob my own place and call the cops!"
ARE_YOU_ABLE_TO_WALK "\[ Pain3 \]I can walk around my house and garage ok, as long as I am careful.  It is tough to walk much further than that though.  It was actually hard to walk in here from the parking lot and I got a pretty close spot."

Chuck and I were lifting the couch and trying to get it downstairs when my back started to hurt."
